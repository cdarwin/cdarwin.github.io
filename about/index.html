<p >I enjoy exploiting <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> to quickly provision infrastructure in the cloud. I have a particular affinity for the <a href="http://golang.org/">Go programming language</a>.</p>
<p>I am currently employed as a Practice Leader for the IT consulting firm, <a href="http://taos.com/">Taos</a>. Through Taos, I have worked on interesting projects for <a href="http://quickbase.intuit.com/">Intuit</a>, <a href="http://skybox.com/">Skybox</a>, <a href="http://recruiting.jobvite.com/">Jobvite</a>, and <a href="http://store.apple.com/us">Apple</a>. As a Practice Leader, I am responsible for a number of internal training programs and mentorships. I am also responsible for a partnership we have with <a href="http://www.yearup.org/">YearUp</a> where we provide young adults with entry level training in Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Python.</p>
<p>I have over 10 years of experience in various areas of systems engineering. Some of my strengths include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Infrastructure architecture and design including bare metal, virtualization, public and private cloud environments</li>
  <li>Configuration Management tools such as cfengine, puppet and chef</li>
  <li>Build automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery</li>
  <li>Programming languages such as C, Java, Go, Bourne Shell, Python, and Ruby</li>
</ul>
