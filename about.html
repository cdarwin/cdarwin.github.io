<p>I am currently employed as a Practice Leader for the consulting firm, <a href="http://taos.com/">Taos</a>. Through Taos, I have worked on interesting projects for <a href="http://quickbase.intuit.com/">Intuit</a>, <a href="http://skybox.com/">Skybox</a>, <a href="http://recruiting.jobvite.com/">Jobvite</a>, and <a href="http://store.apple.com/us">Apple</a>. As a Practice Leader, I am responsible for a number of internal training programs and mentorships. I am also responsible for a partnership with <a href="http://www.yearup.org/">YearUp</a> where we provide young adults with entry level <a href="http://taosmountain.github.io/YearUp/">training</a> in Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Python.</p>
<p>I have over 10 years of experience in various areas of systems engineering. Some of my strengths include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Infrastructure architecture and design including bare metal, virtualization, public and private cloud environments</li>
  <li>Configuration Management tools such as puppet, chef, and ansible</li>
  <li>Build automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery</li>
  <li>Programming languages such as C, Java, Go, Bourne Shell, Python, and Ruby</li>
</ul>

<h2>Co-founder</h2>
<p class="lead"><a href="http://www.performanceci.com/">PerformanceCI</a><br>San Francisco, CA | 2014-present</p>

<p>
  Over a forty eight hour hackathon, my team of four built and open sourced an automated performance testing suite for web applications. It is available on <a href="https://github.com/performanceci/performanceci-core">GitHub</a>. We are actively developing the product in our spare time and plan to launch a hosted service in the near future.

<h2>Co-founder</h2>
<p class="lead">TLB Group<br>San Francisco, CA | 2011-present</p>

<p>
  I co-founded a consulting firm with some colleagues a few years ago. One of our more notable engagements was with 8x8. We automated the deployment of their<a href="http://www.zerigo.com/">Zerigo</a> IaaS web admin UI with Chef. Using this, they were able to more quickly iterate on the product and ultimately offer re-branded versions of it for other clients.

<h2>Practice Leader</h2>
<p class="lead"><a href="http://www.taos.com/">Taos Mountain Inc.</a><br>San Jose, CA | 2011-present</p>

<p><b><i>YearUp</i></b><br />
  I teach a twelve week <a href="http://taosmountain.github.io/YearUp/">course</a> to young adults as an introduction to full stack web application development. The students come in with little to no experience with software programming or Linux. They leave with a deeper understanding of technical problem solving and a web application they can show off to their friends and family.
</p>

<p><b><i>Apple</i></b><br />
  Armed with <a href="http://rspec-puppet.com/">rspec-puppet</a> and <a href="http://serverspec.org/">serverspec</a>, I am driving an initiative of Puppet test coverage to a point where the team can confidently carry out test driven development on the infrastructure codebase. Running Puppet and all supporting software under a single unprivileged user presents very interesting challenges and new ways of thinking about software deployment.
</p>

<p><b><i>Jobvite</i></b><br />
  Using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation templates</a>, I defined "stacks" of services in autoscaling groups and initiated a migration from a hosted application service provider to a higly available, scalable, and region distributed environment in Amazon's public cloud.
</p>

<p><b><i>Skybox</i></b><br />
  <a href="http://skybox.com/">Skybox</a> is an aerospace startup building the world's first coordinated microsatellite constellation. I worked as a Release Manager designing, architecting, and implementing a deployment/activation/rollback procedure for ground software releases going out to remote ground stations, remote processing units, and mission operation control centers.
</p>

<p><b><i>Intuit</i></b><br />
  I worked as the Lead Architect and Engineer on a continuous integration project for <a href="http://quickbase.intuit.com/">Intuit</a>. The project goal was to move the product development team of a rather large Windows based C++ SaaS application into a more agile development environment.
</p>

<h2>Infrastructure Engineer</h2>
<p class="lead"><a href="http://www.iron.io/">Iron.io</a><br>San Francisco, CA | 2012</p>

<p>
  I developed and maintained a proprietary infrastructure deployment tool built with Ruby on Rails. I orchestrated the migration of a core datastore from a shared hosted three node replicaset to a highly available sharded cluster with automated monitoring and metrics alerting. We used datadog and stathat to collect metrics about our backend applications and infrastructure. We used tools such as Pingdom, Papertrail, and PagerDuty to triage alerting of trivial to emergency situations.
</p>

<h2>Senior Systems Engineer</h2>
<p class="lead">FSU Program in Neuroscience</a><br>Tallahassee, FL | 2007-20011</p>

<p>
  I developed all system software and web applications for the Program in Neuroscience at Florida State University. I consolidated hardware with Xen (initially) and (ultimately) VMWare ESXi. I managed a team of support technicians serving roughly 200 faculty, staff and students distributed across the main FSU campus including the Lab Animal Research facility as well as the lab and office of the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.
