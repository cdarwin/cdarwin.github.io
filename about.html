<h2>Co-founder</h2>
<p class="lead"><a href="http://www.performanceci.com/">PerformanceCI</a><br>San Francisco, CA | 2014-present</p>

<p>
  Over a forty eight hour hackathon, a few colleagues and I built and open sourced an automated performance testing suite for web applications. It is available on <a href="https://github.com/performanceci/performanceci-core">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h2>Co-founder</h2>
<p class="lead">TLB Group<br>San Francisco, CA | 2011-present</p>

<h2>Practice Leader</h2>
<p class="lead"><a href="http://www.taos.com/">Taos Mountain Inc.</a><br>San Jose, CA | 2011-present</p>

<p><b><i>YearUp</i></b><br />
  I teach a twelve week course to young adults as an introduction to full stack web application development. The students come in with little to no experience with software programming or Linux. They leave with a deeper understanding of technical problem solving and a web application they can show off to their friends and family.
</p>

<p><b><i>Apple</i></b><br />
  Armed with rspec-puppet and serverspec, I have driven an initiative of Puppet test coverage to a point where the team can confidently carry out test driven development on the infrastructure codebase. Running Puppet and all supporting software under a single unprivileged user has presented very interesting challenges and new ways of thinking about software deployment.
</p>

<p><b><i>Jobvite</i></b><br />
  Using AWS CloudFormation templates, I was able to define "stacks" of services in autoscaling groups to begin a migration from a hosted application service provider into a higly available, scalable, and region distributed environment in Amazon's public cloud.
</p>

<p><b><i>Skybox</i></b><br />
  Skybox is an aerospace startup building the world's first coordinated microsatellite constellation. I have worked as a Release Manager designing, architecting, and implementing a deployment/activation/rollback procedure for ground software releases going out to multiple remote ground stations, remote processing units, and mission operation control centers.
</p>

<p><b><i>Intuit</i></b><br />
  I have worked as the Lead Architect and Engineer on a continuous integration project for Intuit. The project goal was to move the product development team of a rather large Windows based C++ SaaS application into a more agile development environment.
</p>

<h2>Infrastructure Engineer</h2>
<p class="lead"><a href="http://www.iron.io/">Iron.io</a><br>San Francisco, CA | 2012</p>

<p>
  I developed and maintained a proprietary infrastructure deployment tool built with Ruby on Rails. I orchestrated the migration of a core datastore where we moved from a shared hosted three node replicaset to a highly available sharded cluster with automated monitoring and metrics alerting. We used datadog and stathat to collect numerous metrics about our backend applications and entire infrastructure. We used tools such as Pingdom, Papertrail, and PagerDuty to triage alerting of trivial to emergency situations.
</p>

<h2>Senior Systems Engineer</h2>
<p class="lead">FSU Program in Neuroscience</a><br>Tallahassee, FL | 2007-20011</p>

<p>
  I developed all system software and web applications for the Program in Neuroscience at Florida State University. I consolidated hardware on a shoestring budget using Xen and VMWare ESXi hypervisors. I managed a team of support technicians serving roughly 200 faculty, staff and students distributed across the main FSU campus including the Lab Animal Research facility and the lab and office of the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.
