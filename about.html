<p>I am currently employed as a Technical Operation Engineer at <a href="https://www.lucidconnects.com/">Lucid</a>. While at Lucid, I have had the opportunity to increase my exposure to Python, Salt, and Docker. I have helped maintain a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/luciddg/docker-formula">docker-formula</a>. All of our contributions have been accepted upstream for the benefit of the rest of the community. Our team of three has successfully established a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a> principals for the Technical Operations team and set an example to inspire other teams to adopt similar processes.</p>

<p>I have over 10 years of experience in various areas of systems engineering. Some of my strengths include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Infrastructure architecture and design including bare metal, virtualization, public and private cloud environments</li>
  <li>Configuration Management tools such as puppet, chef, salt, and ansible</li>
  <li>Build automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery</li>
  <li>Programming languages such as C, Java, Go, Bourne Shell, Python, and Ruby</li>
</ul>

<h2>Co-founder</h2>
<p class="lead"><a href="http://www.performanceci.com/">PerformanceCI</a><br>San Francisco, CA</p>

<p>
  Over a forty eight hour hackathon, my team of four built and open sourced an automated performance testing suite for web applications. It is available at <a href="https://github.com/performanceci/performanceci-core">GitHub</a>. We are actively developing the product in our spare time and plan to launch a hosted service in the future.
</p>

<h2>Co-founder</h2>
<p class="lead">TLB Group<br>San Francisco, CA</p>

<p>
  I co-founded a consulting firm with some colleagues a few years ago. One of our more notable engagements was with 8x8. We automated the deployment of their <a href="http://www.zerigo.com/">Zerigo</a> IaaS web admin UI with Chef. Using this, they were able to more quickly iterate on the product and ultimately offer re-branded versions of it for other clients.

<h2>Technical Operation Engineer</h2>
<p class="lead"><a href="https://www.lucidconnects.com/">Lucid</a><br>Oakland, CA</p>

<p>
  As a member of a three person Technical Operations team, we are primarily responsible for production systems at Lucid. Together, we have moved nearly all critical supporting services from hand made and largely unmanaged KVM images to Docker service containers managed by <a href="http://saltstack.com/">Salt</a> We maintain a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/luciddg/docker-formula">docker-formula</a> where all of our contributions have been accepted upstream for the benefit of the rest of the community. I am particularly proud of our accomplishments establishing a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a> principals which has added countless value to our own team. We have set an example to inspire other teams to adopt similar process improvements.

<h2>Mobile Apps Automation Team Lead</h2>
<p class="lead"><a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a><br>Sunnyvale, CA</p>

<p>
  I lead a team of developers under the Operations umbrella of the Mobile Apps organization responsible for the Apple Store iOS clients. We developed a suit of tools around deployment automation for internal use by other developers and operations team members. The core product leveraged <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/mcollective">Marionette Collective</a> for orchestration of many deployment and maintenance tasks. The product consisted of a distributed <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> HTTP API with web and iOS client applications.

<h2>Practice Leader</h2>
<p class="lead"><a href="http://www.taos.com/">Taos Mountain Inc.</a><br>San Jose, CA</p>

<p><b><i>YearUp</i></b><br />
  I have taught a twelve week <a href="http://taosmountain.github.io/YearUp/">course</a> to young adults as an introduction to full stack web application development. The students come in with little to no experience with software programming or Linux. They leave with a deeper understanding of technical problem solving and a web application they can show off to their friends and family.
</p>

<p><b><i>Apple</i></b><br />
  Armed with <a href="http://rspec-puppet.com/">rspec-puppet</a> and <a href="http://serverspec.org/">serverspec</a>, I lead an initiative of Puppet test coverage to a point where the team can confidently carry out test driven development on the infrastructure codebase. Running Puppet and all supporting software under a single unprivileged user presented very interesting challenges and new ways of thinking about software deployment.
</p>

<p><b><i>Jobvite</i></b><br />
  Using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation templates</a>, I defined "stacks" of services in autoscaling groups and initiated a migration from a hosted application service provider to a higly available, scalable, and region distributed environment in Amazon's public cloud.
</p>

<p><b><i>Skybox</i></b><br />
  <a href="http://skybox.com/">Skybox</a> is an aerospace startup building the world's first coordinated microsatellite constellation. I worked as a Release Manager designing, architecting, and implementing a deployment/activation/rollback procedure for ground software releases going out to remote ground stations, remote processing units, and mission operation control centers.
</p>

<p><b><i>Intuit</i></b><br />
  I worked as the Lead Architect and Engineer on a continuous integration project for <a href="http://quickbase.intuit.com/">Intuit</a>. The project goal was to move the product development team of a rather large Windows based C++ SaaS application into a more agile development environment.
</p>

<h2>Infrastructure Engineer</h2>
<p class="lead"><a href="http://www.iron.io/">Iron.io</a><br>San Francisco, CA</p>

<p>
  I developed and maintained a proprietary infrastructure deployment tool built with Ruby on Rails. I orchestrated the migration of a core datastore from a shared hosted three node replicaset to a highly available sharded cluster with automated monitoring and metrics alerting. We used datadog and stathat to collect metrics about our backend applications and infrastructure. We used tools such as Pingdom, Papertrail, and PagerDuty to triage alerting of trivial to emergency situations.
</p>

<h2>Senior Systems Engineer</h2>
<p class="lead">FSU Program in Neuroscience</a><br>Tallahassee, FL</p>

<p>
  I developed all system software and web applications for the Program in Neuroscience at Florida State University. I consolidated hardware with Xen (initially) and (ultimately) VMWare ESXi. I managed a team of support technicians serving roughly 200 faculty, staff and students distributed across the main FSU campus including the Lab Animal Research facility as well as the lab and office of the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.
